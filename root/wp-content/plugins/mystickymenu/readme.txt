This sticky menu plugin will make your menu or header stick to the top of page, when scrolled down and up. Also create a beautiful Welcome bar with it.

== Description ==
<strong>This sticky menu plugin will make your menu or header sticky on top of page, after desired number of pixels when scrolled. You can use it also to create a Welcome bar for announcements, promotion and more. This lightweight plugin will help your visitors navigate easily and reach to the navigation menu without wasting time. Install My Sticky Menu and improve your website’s user experience! If you want to change the CSS style, disable on scroll down or disable on specific pages. check out the <a href="https://premio.io/downloads/mystickymenu/" target="_blank" title="mystickymenu pro plans">Pro version</a>.</strong>

By default, sticky menu is designed to use element class ".navbar" as "Sticky Class". That value should be modified in plugin settings for different themes to make it work. Sticky Class is actually nothing more than an element class (or id) of the element that should become sticky. 

<strong>📢 New feature:</strong> Welcome Bar. Use this powerful feature to create a beautiful floating sticky bar. No coding skill required, just turn it on, set up your announcement text and button, and voilà - your top bar is good to go! 

With more than 60,000+ active installs and around 100 five-stars reviews, you can be sure that My Sticky Menu plugin is the right fit for your website.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to find Sticky Class, what should I enter here? =
So this depends on what you want to make sticky and what theme do you use, but for example if you want your menu to be sticky, than you can examine the code (in firefox right click and “View page source”) and find HTML element in which your menu is situated. This element have some class or id, and that’s the Sticky Class we need. If using class than don’t forget to ad dot (.) in front of class name, or hash (#) in front of id. Twenty Thirteen default working class is ".navbar" without of quotes.

= Is there any way to restrict the width to the width of the header, rather than it being full width? =
Yes, just leave "Sticky Background Color" field blank (clear). Than if needed define custom background color for sticky header inside ".myfixed css class" field using .myfixed class. 

= Ho do I add small logo to the menu? =
That will depend on a theme you use, but if initially your menu and logo are in one div than you can use that div class or id in myStickymenu settings. 

If not you can change that in your header template file and add logo and menu divs inside new div with some custom class or id, than use that class or id in myStickymenu settings as a sticky class.

In CSS you can style your custom class while not sticky using custom class you added before. Furthermore you can style your menu while sticky using .myfixed class which is added by js to your custom class while sticky is active. 

In some cases you can use the whole header div and than just style it different with .myfixed class, hide what you don’t need using CSS display:none; property, and position logo and menu as you like.
